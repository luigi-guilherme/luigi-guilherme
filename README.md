## 👋 Hi there! I'm Luigi Guilherme

🎓 I'm currently a **Computer Engineering** student at **Faculdade Engenheiro Salvador Arena**, where I'm diving deeper into the world of technology and software development.

💻 I'm always looking to learn new things! At the moment, I'm focused on:
- Building applications with **Java** and **C#**
- Working with **MySQL** relational databases
- Web development using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**

📚 I've been involved in several academic projects that strengthened my knowledge in object-oriented programming, system modeling, and logic development. I also have experience with hardware-related projects, such as electronic circuit simulations.

💼 I have professional experience as an infrastructure and help desk apprentice at **Lorenzetti**, where I developed skills such as:
- Technical support and problem-solving
- Equipment maintenance and organization
- Effective communication with users

🧠 I'm constantly working on improving both technically and personally. I adapt quickly, have leadership experience, and love working in teams. I'm also aware of the importance of networking and I'm improving my self-assessment and career planning skills.

🌍 Location: São Paulo - SP, Brazil
